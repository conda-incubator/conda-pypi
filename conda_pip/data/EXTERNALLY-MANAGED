Error=You are trying to modify a conda environment!
  
  If you want to install PyPI packages into this conda environment,
  please consider using 'conda pip install ...' instead. 
  This will make a few checks to ensure that the PyPI packages 
  you want to install will not disrupt your conda environment.

  If you still want to proceed with 'pip install ...', then
  add the '--break-system-packages' to your command, but be aware
  that you might experience unexpected issues.
