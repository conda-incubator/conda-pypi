Error=You are trying to modify a conda environment!

  If you want to install PyPI packages into this conda environment,
  please consider using 'conda pypi install ...' instead.
  This will make a few checks to ensure that the PyPI packages
  you want to install will not disrupt your conda environment.

  If you still want to proceed with 'pip install ...', you can continue
  at your own risk by doing one of the following:

  - Add the '--break-system-packages' flag to your command
  - Set the 'PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES' environment variable to '1'

  Be aware that this might render your conda environment unusable!
