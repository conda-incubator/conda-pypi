# Quick start

## Installation

`conda-pypi` is a `conda` plugin that needs to be installed next to `conda` in the `base` environment:

```
conda install -n base conda-pypi
```

## Basic usage

`conda-pypi` provides several {doc}`features`. Some of them are discussed here:

### Safer pip installations

Assuming you have an activated conda environment named `my-python-env` that includes `python` and `pip` installed, and `conda-forge` in your configured channels, you can run `conda pip` like this:

```
conda pip install requests
```

This will install `requests` from conda-forge, along with all its dependencies, because everything is available there. The dependency tree translates one-to-one from PyPI to conda, so there are no issues.

```
conda pip install build
```

This will install the `python-build` package from conda-forge. Note how `conda pip` knows how to map the different project names. This is done via semi-automated mappings provided by the `grayskull`, `cf-graph-countyfair` and `parselmouth` projects.

```
conda pip install PyQt5
```

This will install `pyqt=5` from conda, which also brings `qt=5` separately. This is because `pyqt` on conda _depends_ on the Qt libraries instead of bundling them in the same package. Again, the `PyQt5 -> pyqt` mapping is handled as expected.

```
conda pip install ib_insync
```

This will install `ib-insync` from conda-forge. Since the conda ecosystem does not normalize dashes and underscores, we have to try all the combinations when searching for the equivalent in conda-forge. This heuristic is not as robust as the mappings mentioned above, though! We are hoping
there are no conda packages where the underscore and dash variants refer to different packages.

```
conda pip install 5-exercise-upload-to-pypi
```

This package is not available on conda-forge. We will analyze the dependency tree and install all the available ones with `conda`. The rest will be installed with `pip install --no-deps`.


### Lockfiles support

`conda-pypi` integrates with `conda list --explicit` to add some custom comments so your `@EXPLICIT` lockfiles contain PyPI information. `conda-pypi` also integrates with `conda install` and `conda create` to process these special lines. See more at {ref}`pypi-lines`.

You can generate these lockfiles with `conda list --explicit --md5`, and they will look like this:

```
# This file may be used to create an environment using:
# $ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
# platform: osx-arm64

```

### Environment protection

`conda-pypi` ships a special file, `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`, that will be installed in:

- The `base` environment.
- All new environments that include `pip`.
- Existing environments that already have `pip`, but only after running a conda command on them.

More details at {ref}`externally-managed`.
