# Features

`conda-pypi` uses the `conda` plugin system to implement several features
that make `conda` integrate better with the PyPI ecosystem:

## The `conda pypi` subcommand

This subcommand provides a safer way to install PyPI packages in conda
environments by converting them to `.conda` format when possible. It offers two
main subcommands that handle different aspects of PyPI integration.

### `conda pypi install`

The install command takes PyPI packages and converts them to `.conda` format
when possible, falling back to direct pip installation when needed. The
process begins with dependency resolution using pip's own dependency resolver
to determine what packages need to be installed.

Explicitly requested packages are always installed from PyPI and converted
to `.conda` format to ensure you get exactly what you asked for. For
dependencies, conda-pypi chooses the best source using a
conda-first approach. If a dependency is available on conda channels, it will
be installed with `conda` directly. If not available on conda channels, the
dependency will be converted from PyPI to `.conda` format.

The system uses multiple sources for package name mapping which are
currently hardcoded.  In the future, it will use other means to have
a more active way to get current name mappings. VCS and editable packages
are handled as special cases and installed directly with `pip install --no-deps`.

You can preview what would be installed without making changes using
`--dry-run`, install packages in editable development mode with `--editable`
or `-e`, and force dependency resolution from PyPI without using conda
channels using `--override-channels`.

### `conda pypi convert`

The convert command transforms PyPI packages to `.conda` format without
installing them, which is useful for creating conda packages from PyPI
distributions or preparing packages for offline installation. You can specify
where to save the converted packages using `-d`, `--dest`, or `--output-dir`.
The command supports converting multiple packages at once and can skip conda
channel checks entirely with `--override-channels` to convert directly from
PyPI.

Here are some common usage patterns:

```bash
# Convert packages to current directory
conda pypi convert httpx cowsay

# Convert to specific directory
conda pypi convert -d ./my_packages httpx cowsay

# Convert without checking conda channels first
conda pypi convert --override-channels some-pypi-only-package
```

## PyPI-to-Conda Conversion Engine

`conda-pypi` includes a powerful conversion engine that enables direct
conversion of pure Python wheels to `.conda` packages with proper translation of
Python package metadata to conda format. The system includes name
mapping of PyPI dependencies to conda equivalents and provides cross-platform
support for package conversion, ensuring that converted packages work
across different operating systems and architectures.

## `conda install` integrations

The system provides clear error messages if PyPI package installation fails
and uses the same conversion logic as `conda pypi install` for
dependency resolution. This enables full environment reproducibility that
includes both conda and converted PyPI packages, ensuring that environments
can be recreated exactly as they were originally configured.

## Editable Package Support

`conda-pypi` provides comprehensive support for editable (development)
installations, making it ideal for development environments where code is
frequently modified. The system supports both version control system packages
and local packages.

For VCS packages, you can install directly from git URLs with automatic
cloning. The system caches VCS repositories locally for improved performance
and manages temporary directories and repository clones automatically. Local
package support allows you to install packages from local project directories
in editable mode, which is perfect for active development workflows.

Here are some common usage patterns for editable installations:

```bash
# Install from git repository in editable mode
conda pypi install -e git+https://github.com/user/project.git

# Install local project in editable mode
conda pypi install -e ./my-project/

# Multiple editable packages
conda pypi install -e ./package1/ -e git+https://github.com/user/package2.git
```

## `conda env` integrations

:::{admonition} Coming soon
:class: seealso

`environment.yml` files famously allow a `pip` subsection in their
`dependencies`. This is handled internally by `conda env` via a `pip`
subprocess. We are adding new plugin hooks so `conda-pypi` can handle these
in the same way we do with the `conda pypi` subcommand.

## Environment marker files

`conda-pypi` adds support for
[PEP-668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/)'s
[`EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/)
environment marker files. These files tell `pip` and other PyPI installers
not to install or remove any packages in that environment, guiding users
towards safer alternatives.

When these marker files are present, they display a message letting users
know that the `conda pypi` subcommand is available as a safer alternative. The
primary goal is to avoid accidental overwrites that could break your conda
environment. If you need to use `pip` directly, you can still do so by adding
the `--break-system-packages` flag, though this is generally not recommended
in conda environments.
